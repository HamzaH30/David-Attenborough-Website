          "It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of
          excitement; the greatest source of visual beauty; the greatest source
          of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life
          that makes life worth living."

          <strong>Sir David Frederick Attenborough</strong> is an English
          broadcaster, writer, and most importantly, an environmentalist. He is
          known for his innovative nature documentaries and television shows
          that have completely transformed the world’s view of wild animals. His
          work has led to a deeper interest in the planet’s most precious and
          fragile species.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Attenborough was born on May 8, 1926, in London, England to
          Frederick Attenborough and Mary Clegg. He grew up in Leicester where
          his father was the principal of the University College. David
          Attenborough has an elder brother, Richard, who is known for his
          career as an actor and film producer. He also has a younger brother
          and two adoptive sisters.

          David Attenborough’s interest in nature started from an early age. His
          childhood was spent creating a collection of stones, fossils, and
          natural specimens. His collection was admired by Jacquetta Hawkes,
          which further encouraged him to study nature. At age 10, he and his
          brother, Richard, attended a lecture by Archibald Belaney. David
          Attenborough was heavily inspired by Belaney’s advocacy of
          conservation. When the Zoology Department needed a supply of newts,
          David Attenborough went to a nearby pond and sold the newts he had
          collected for 3 pence each.

          <blockquote>
            "[David] was bowled over by the man's determination to save the
            beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the
            Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster
            should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that
            mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and
            plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that
            has remained part of Dave's own credo to this day."
