            I can’t pretend that I got involved with filming the natural world
            fifty years ago because I had some great banner to carry about
            conservation – not at all, I always had a huge pleasure in just
            watching the natural world and seeing what happens. But as I went on
            making them it became more and more apparent that the creatures that
            were giving me so much joy were under threat. The fun is in
            delighting in the animals but if you do that you owe them something
            so you have an obligation to speak out and to do what you can to
            protect them.

          David Attenborough completed a three-month training course at the
          British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and in 1952, became a
          television producer working for the BBC. In 1954, his first “hit”
          educational program, <em>Zoo Quest</em>, was broadcasted. Together
          with Jack Lester, he would host the show and film live animals in the
          wild and zoo. The immense popularity of the show led to more
          educational content being produced by the BBC.

          In March 1965, Attenborough accepted a position as Controller of BBC
          2. He was responsible for producing shows including
          <em>The Forsyte Saga</em>, <em>The Ascent of Man</em>,
          <em>Civilisation</em>, and Monty Python’s <em>Flying Circus</em>. He
          was also one of the first people to introduce colour television to the
          BBC. During this time, David Attenborough also filmed a cultural
          history film, <em>A Blank on the Map</em>.

          In 1972, David Attenborough resigned from his position and pursued
          writing and producing educational content as a freelancer. In 1979,
          his most remarkable series, <em>The Life Series</em>, was broadcasted
          starting with the first episode, <em>Life on Earth</em>. Eight more
          episodes would be released over the next few decades. This series
          cemented David Attenborough’s reputation as a
          <strong>leading television naturalist</strong> and an
          <strong>iconic figure</strong> in British cultural life.

          Another popular project that David Attenborough worked on was
          narrating the <em>Wildlife on One</em> program for 28 years! It
          attracted around 8 &mdash; 10 million viewers every week, and one of
          its episodes was voted the best wildlife documentary of all time on
          the BBC channel.

            Since I started filming in the 1950s, on average, wild animal
            populations have more than halved. I look at these images now and I
            realize that, although as a young man I felt I was out there in the
            wild experiencing the untouched natural world… it was an illusion.
            Those forests and plains and seas were already emptying.
