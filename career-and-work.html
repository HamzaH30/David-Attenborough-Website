          David Attenborough completed a three-month training course at the
          British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and in 1952, became a
          television producer working for the BBC. In 1954, his first “hit”
          educational program, <em>Zoo Quest</em>, was broadcasted. Together
          with Jack Lester, he would host the show and film live animals in the
          wild and zoo. The immense popularity of the show led to more
          educational content being produced by the BBC.
